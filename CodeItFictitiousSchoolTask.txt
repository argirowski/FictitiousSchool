📌 Work Sample
What You’ll Be Doing
You will create an application form for a fictitious school to accept applications from companies interested in attending their courses.
Each course is available on different dates. All applications must be saved in a database and include the following details:

🔹 Course Information:
-- Course ID
-- Course Date

🔸 Company Information:
Company Name
Company Phone Number
Company Email

🔹 Participant Information:
1 or more participants, each consisting of:
-- Name
-- Phone Number
-- Email

🛠 Expectations
✔ Build the signup flow using Microsoft .NET Core, C#, and related backend technologies.
✔ Use any frontend stack you are comfortable with; we prefer React for the UI, but any SPA technology works.
✔ Define a suitable database structure and implement appropriate design patterns.
✔ For the backend, use the Clean (Onion) architecture.
✔ Include a README to describe how to get the application up and running.

📦 Delivery
-- Host the code as a repository on GitHub or any other Git-based service under your profile (set to private)
-- During our meeting, walk us through the code and explain your choices regarding frameworks, data structure, architecture, and your overall approach.

📚 Resources
-- Design Files: Available in the design folder.
-- Courses Data: Available as JSON in the endpoints folder.
-- Font: Source Sans Pro.

✨ If You Have Time
These additional items are optional, but if completed, they will be reviewed along with the base work sample:
✅ API with Endpoints: Create an API to expose the data/applications. Document it with tools like Swagger to allow the school's IT systems to consume it.
✅ Minimize Spam: Implement strategies to reduce spam submissions in the form.

🎉 Have Fun!
This test is about understanding how you approach and implement a common task. It’s not about pointing fingers or finding faults—we’re excited to see how you think and create!
